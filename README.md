The aim of this project is to explore virtual sound environments with mobile devices, using iOS as a main platform and Pure Data (Pd) as a backend for sound processing. The underlying calculations are based on human's natural and linear interpolation between virtual sound sources. As a result, the developed application allows user to ``walk around'' virtual concerts, as well as to experiment with positions of sound sources by moving them GUI manually.
